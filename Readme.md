HELLO! This is Dharmesh Bhanushali here. The challenge here is to build a URL lookup service

CHALLENGE

We have an HTTP proxy that is scanning traffic looking for malware URL's. Before allowing HTTP connections to be made, this proxy asks a service that maintains several databases of malware URL's if the resource being requested is known to contain malware. 
Write a small web service that responds to GET requests where the caller passes in a URL and the service responds with some information about that URL. The GET requests would look like this:
  
                GET /urlinfo/1/{hostname_and_port}/{original_path_and_query_string}
 
The caller wants to know if it is safe to access that URL or not. As the implementor you get to choose the response format and structure. These lookups are blocking users from accessing the URL until the caller receives a response from your service.

There are extra credits for the following-
1) The size of the URL list could grow infinitely, how might you scale this beyond the memory capacity of the system? Bonus if you implement this. 

2) The number of requests may exceed the capacity of this system, how might you solve that? Bonus if you implement this.

3) What are some strategies you might use to update the service with new URLs? Updates may be as much as 5 thousand URLs a day with updates arriving every 10 minutes.



APPROACH 

We create a file named url.html
We run this file to use this service.
This file behaves as a client that takes the url from user and puts the GET request to the server to obtain the RESPONSE. The response which is obtained from server to the client has the information about the URL that if it is safe to access or it is a Malware URL.

We pass a jquery from this HTML client to the server as a sent GET Request. The server uses Flask with python for checking the URL obtained in the jquery with the URL list in the database file. The database file is a text file which has all the Malware URL. We read the file using a file read handle in the python based server script.

This server scripts check for the URL match and if the URL matches with any one of the comma separated URL list then it sends the response saying that “This URL contains Malware and it is Unsafe to access it”. But when the URL from the GET request does not matches with any of the URL from the list then the server sends a response to the HTML client saying, “This URL is safe to visit”.



USING THE SERVICE

Open URL.html and enter the URL you wish to visit in the text box and then press Validate



RESULTS

You will be redirected to the URL if it is safe to visit or you will be displayed with the message saying that the URL consists a malware.
