HELLO! This is Dharmesh Bhanushali here. The challenge here is to build a URL lookup service



USING THE SERVICE

1. Install Python 2.7 or 3.0 on your device - 
for MAC - http://www.pyladies.com/blog/Get-Your-Mac-Ready-for-Python-Programming/
for WINDOWS - http://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/

2. Install pip and Flask on your device.
follow the instructions on this page for installing FLASK and PIP
On MAC - http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/alee/cs40/penv/installFlaskOnMac.html
on WINDOWS - http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/alee/cs40/penv/installFlaskOnWindows.html

3. Clone all the files in to your system.
4. Open the terminal and change the directory to the location of the downloaded directory.
5. Run the server using the command below, so that it can serve the client request. ---> python server.py 
6. Open the browser and run the html file using the following URL.  ---> http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/url.html
7. Now you have your server running and you have connected the html client to server using the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 and port number 5000
8. Enter any URL and press Validate to check weather these url is a malware url
9. To check another URL, refresh or reload the page and you will be good to go.



USE THE FOLLOWING URL'S TO CHECK THAT THESE HAVE A MALWARE.

1) www.linkedin.com

2) www.google.com

3) http://cats.petbreeds.com/l/27/Russian-Blue

4) www.ebay.com

5) www.facebook.com

6) www.gmail.com

7) www.yahoo.com

8) https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/197619402?trkInfo=searchKeywordString%3ABusiness%2BAnalyst%2CsearchLocationString%3A%252C%2B%2Cvertical%3Ajobs%2CpageNum%3A1%2Cposition%3A2%2CMSRPsearchId%3A366232809_1475992308117&refId=366232809_1475992308117&trk=jobs_jserp_job_listing_text

(USE ANY OTHER URL TO CHECK AND IT WILL SHOW THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A MALWARE)



RESULTS

You will be displayed with a message saying that this URL contains Malware and it is not safe to visit.
If the URL does not matches the above mentioned URL then it means that the URL is not a Malware URL and hence you will be displayed with the message as " The URL is totally safe to visit!!"
